    <h1>Filters Platform for Wrike</h1>

    <p class="project__text"><strong>Role:</strong> Principal Product Designer<br><strong>Timeline:</strong> 2024<br><strong>Scope:</strong> Redesigning Wrike‚Äôs filtering system for core product views, Dashboards, Automations, and the new Datahub product<br><strong>Impact:</strong> A reusable, system-wide solution that improved usability for new users, delivered advanced capabilities for power users, and unblocked multiple product teams</p>

    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p class="project__text">In 2024, I redesigned Wrike‚Äôs outdated filtering system ‚Äì a core experience used daily across the product. Users struggled with even simple filtering tasks, while advanced scenarios were impossible. I run a series of interviews with experienced users to understand what functionality they miss and tested the existing UI with new users to find critical interaction challenges ‚Äì and then replaced the clunky old filters with a streamlined filter bar, introducing new features like <strong>sliding date ranges, and / or, exclusion filters</strong> and more. [something about happy users]. I built it as a reusable system for other designers, which later powered Automations, Dashboards, and Wrike‚Äôs new Datahub product.</p>
    <p class="project__text">[üí° Visual: before/after screenshots of filters, highlighting simplicity and new capabilities]</p>

    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p class="project__text">I first discovered the problem while working on Wrike‚Äôs <strong>Table view</strong>, where users manage large, spreadsheet-like projects. In interviews, both new and experienced users complained about struggling to find information in complex tables.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>New users</strong> failed basic filtering tasks during UI testing sessions. People didn‚Äôt understand if any filters were applied, and even tasks like ‚ÄúSee all tasks in Active status‚Äù were impeded by the old filters complex hierarchical structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Experienced users</strong> told us filtering didn‚Äôt work as expected or lacked key options. Many clients wanted to automate scenarios of seeing planned work (‚ÄúEach sprint we need to manually look for the tasks with specific dates instead of setting up <em>due this sprint</em> once‚Äù). Others were struggling with navigating a portfolio of projects: ‚ÄúI want to find <em>overdue tasks</em> in multiple <em>projects assigned to me</em> ‚Äì but I can‚Äôt filter by both at the same time‚Äù.</li>
      <li><strong>Analytics</strong> confirmed filters were heavily used across Wrike ‚Äî making their poor usability a critical blocker.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project__text">At the same time, the company‚Äôs OKRs emphasized <strong>improving new user engagement</strong>, and a new internal product (later launched as <strong>Datahub</strong>) required best-in-class filtering. Filters were no longer just a UI element ‚Äî they were becoming strategic infrastructure.</p>
    <p class="project__text">[üí° Visual: screenshot of old filters, user quotes, or test failure data]</p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p class="project__text">Filters were used in many different contexts ‚Äî views, dashboards, automations, and soon, Datahub. Each had slightly different data types, rules, and technical constraints.</p>
    <p class="project__text">The challenge was to design <strong>one system</strong> that could:</p>
    
      <ul class="project__text">
        <li>Work across all these contexts with minimal tweaks</li>
        <li>Support advanced scenarios without overwhelming beginners</li>
        <li>Be easy for other designers to adopt and extend</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p class="project__text">[üí° Visual: diagram showing filtering in multiple contexts (Views, Dashboards, Automations, Datahub)]</p>

    <h2>Discovery</h2>
    <p class="project__text">I researched two main directions. First, I wanted to understand what existing requests could be solved with filters ‚Äì even if the users themselves didn‚Äôt ask for filters improvements specifically. I analyzed all the feedback regarding the search for information and navigating in complex projects and project portfolios. When interviewing users directly, talking to our customer success organisation, and reading what people were asking for in the community forums, I heard several repeating requests.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Planned work: support different time frames.</li>
      <li>Exclusion ‚Äì well, that was an easy one: very filter-specific case.</li>
      <li>Chained filters: find data by related data, eg all tasks</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="project__text">It helped me to shape the solution: adding new functionality was justified be it useful for the cases.</p>
    <p class="project__text">[some pic of solution for the three? Or some quotes from community, but it‚Äôs booooring]</p>
    <p class="project__text">Second, I needed to find the most critical issues with the existing UI. Together with the UX researcher, we ran several tests with people who‚Äôd never used Wrike before: we asked them to perform the basic filter scenarios ‚Äì those most popular in our analytics data.</p>
    <p class="project__text">This allowed me to focus on the issues mostly affecting new users, which was the company focus at the moment: the main metric was new users retention, and we hoped to improve it by making the basic features easier to use. It also helped to establish a benchmark for the new solution and validate it later on (obviously, it would have to perform better).</p>
    <p class="project__text">[the pic with the problems found? From some presentation]</p>

    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <p class="project__text"><strong>Filter bar with search</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>simple for 95% of use cases</li>
      <li>easy to discover and understand what filters are applied</li>
      <li>Quickly access filters and edit / remove unneeded</li>
      <li>Search right away</li>
      <li>Table columns above</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project__text">[video]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Future AI</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project__text"><strong>Unified system for all data types: helped to adapt the system for admin settings and so on.</strong></p>
    <p class="project__text">[pic with different filters]</p>
    <p class="project__text"><strong>New features</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Super duper filter for dates</li>
      <li>And or?</li>
      <li>Not</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project__text"><strong>What didn‚Äôt make the cut</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Builder? Not sure if I have a pic ‚Äì powerful but too complex for most scenarios.</li>
      <li>Clickable chips because of the localisation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Benchmark Testing:</strong> Ran side-by-side usability tests with new users on old filters vs. new filter bar ‚Üí showed clear improvements in success rates. [üí° Insert metric if possible]</li>
      <li><strong>Alpha Testing:</strong> Partnered with engineers to release an early alpha version in Wrike‚Äôs internal account and to pilot customers. Collected real feedback on advanced cases with real datasets.</li>
      <li><strong>Iterative Refinement:</strong> Incorporated feedback from sales, early adopters, and power users.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="project__text">[üí° Visuals: testing scenarios, usability results, quotes from alpha users]</p>

    <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
    <p class="project__text">The new features were an immediate success between the power users, especially the big enterprise accounts. Thanks to the introduction of new date filters, we secured several account expansions and prevented a couple of churn cases.</p>
    <p class="project__text">Since the new filters were introduced, we see an improvement in the new users retention (on average, people spend more days exploring the product while on trial), which our analytics tie with rising conversion to paid accounts. However, I can‚Äôt of course be confident that filters alone contributed to this.</p>
    <p class="project__text">Finally, new filters were successfully adopted by other teams and introduced to work in different contexts with different data types: users in admin settings, tasks in automation, widgets in dashboards. They significantly expanded the Automation capabilities and became the foundation of the new Wrike product: Datahub, an Airtable rival.</p>
    <p class="project__text">[üí° Visuals: new filtering UI in each context (Views, Dashboards, Automations, Datahub)]</p>
    <p class="project__text">And for me, the project was a turning point in how I approached design at the principal level:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It wasn‚Äôt just about fixing a UI, but about <strong>creating infrastructure for the whole product</strong>.</li>
      <li>I drove the effort end-to-end ‚Äî from framing the opportunity, through research and design, to delivery and adoption.</li>
      <li>Acting as a <strong>design system leader and cross-team facilitator</strong> proved as important as the design craft itself.</li>
    </ul>
